                                Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the authors, use this license in order to protect your freedom.

The GPL v3 is an updated version of the GPL designed to address new challenges posed by the software and hardware industries.

This license applies to all the files in the Beatsight project, unless a specific file contains a different license notice.
